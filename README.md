# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon
## Project Overview

- In this project, I use the ![AutoGluon library](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. 
- I use Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition.
- This project  demonstrates my ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record my personal optimization of the problem.
 
## What about bike-sharing demand?
- Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. 
- Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

## Main Steps
- Project Setup
- Complete the Jupyter Notebook
- Complete the Competition Report
- Standout Suggestions

## Environment and Dependencies
- If you're going to be working on your own machine, make sure you have everything listed below.
   - python 3.7
   - jupyter lab
   -  MXNet 1.8
   -  AutoGluon

## Project Instructions
  -  Create an account with Kaggle.
  -  Download the Kaggle dataset using the kaggle python library.
  -  Train a model using AutoGluonâ€™s Tabular Prediction and submit predictions to Kaggle for ranking.
  -  Use Pandas to do some exploratory analysis and create a new feature, saving new versions of the train and test dataset.
  -  Rerun the model and submit the new predictions for ranking.
  -  Tune at least 3 different hyperparameters from AutoGluon and resubmit predictions to rank higher on Kaggle.
  -  Write up a report on how improvements (or not) were made by either creating additional features or tuning hyperparameters, and why you think one or the other is the best approach to invest more time in.
