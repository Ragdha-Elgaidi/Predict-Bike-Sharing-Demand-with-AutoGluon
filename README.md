# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon
## Project Overview

- In this project, I use the ![AutoGluon library](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. 
- I use Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition.
- This project  demonstrates my ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record my personal optimization of the problem.
 
## What about bike-sharing demand?
- Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. 
- Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

## Main Steps
- Project Setup
- Complete the Jupyter Notebook
- Complete the Competition Report
- Standout Suggestions

# Project Summary
- The project will give you the opportunity to:
   - Create a model for the Predict Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition
   - Use AutoGluon to build and evaluate models
   - Compete in Kaggle by submitting your model and receive a ranking
   - Create a report of ML discoveries so you can showcase your work
